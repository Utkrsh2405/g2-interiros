# Images Directory

## Required Images

### who-we-are.jpg
- A modern interior design living room image
- Recommended dimensions: 1200x800px or similar 3:2 ratio
- Should show elegant furniture, good lighting, and modern decor
- This image is used in the "Who We Are?" section on the home page

## How to Add Images

1. Place your images in this directory
2. Reference them in components using `/images/filename.jpg`
3. Next.js will automatically optimize them

## Placeholder

Until you add the actual image, the component will show Next.js's default broken image placeholder.
To add your image, simply drop `who-we-are.jpg` into this folder.
